Characteristics of deegree WMTS
-------------------------------

deegree WMTS is an implementation of the `OGC Web Map Tile Service specification <http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wmts>`_. Notable features:

* Implements Basic WMTS standard 1.0.0 (KVP)
* High performance and excellent scalability
* Supports different backends, such as GeoTIFF, remote WMS or file system tile image hierarchies
* Supports on-the-fly caching (using EHCache)
* Supports GetFeatureInfo for remote WMS backends

.. tip::
  In order to learn the setup and configuration of a deegree-based WMTS, we recommend to read :ref:`anchor-installation` and :ref:`anchor-lightly` first. Continue with :ref:`anchor-configuration-basics` and :ref:`anchor-configuration-wmts`.
