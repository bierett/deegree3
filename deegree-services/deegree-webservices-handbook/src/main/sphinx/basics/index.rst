Configuration basics
====================

In the previous chapter, you learned how to access and log in to the deegree service console and how to download and activate example workspaces. This chapter introduces the basic concepts of deegree webservices configuration:

* The deegree workspace and the active workspace directory
* Workspace files and resources
* Workspace directories and resource types
* Resource identifiers and dependencies
* Usage of the service console for workspace configuration

The final section of this chapter describes recommended practices for creating your own workspace. The remaining chapters of the documentation describe the individual workspace resource formats in detail.
