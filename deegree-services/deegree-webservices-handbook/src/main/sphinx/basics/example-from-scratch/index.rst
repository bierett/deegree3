Start from example or from scratch

For creating your own workspace, you have two options. Option 1 is to use an existing workspace as a template and adapt it to your needs. Option 2 is to start from scratch, using an empty workspace. Adapting an existing workspace makes a lot of sense if your use-case is close to the scenario of the workspace. For example, if you want to set up INSPIRE View and Download Services, it is a good option to use :ref:`anchor-workspace-inspire` as a starting point.

In order to create a new workspace, simply create a new directory in the ``.deegree`` directory.

.. figure:: ../../images/workspace-new.png
    :target: ../../_images/workspace-new.png

   Creating the new workspace ``myscenario``

Afterwards, switch to the new workspace using the services console, as described in :ref:`anchor-downloading-workspaces`.
